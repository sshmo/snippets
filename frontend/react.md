# Toolchain

    A JavaScript build toolchain typically consists of:

    A package manager, such as Yarn or npm. It lets you take advantage of a vast ecosystem of third-party packages, and easily install or update them.

    A bundler, such as webpack or Parcel. It lets you write modular code and bundle it together into small packages to optimize load time.
    
    A compiler such as Babel. It lets you write modern JavaScript code that still works in older browsers.

# 'creat-react-app@latest' is not in the npm registry.
